Facial Emotion Recognition Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing facial emotions from images. Facial emotion recognition has significant applications in various fields such as psychology, security, marketing, and user experience design. This notebook outlines the initial steps in creating such a model, starting with necessary imports and presumably followed by data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and application.
